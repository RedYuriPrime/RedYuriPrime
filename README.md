- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedYuriPrime
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation. After basing this around a Fibaro system for 12 months, I moved onto Indigo 7 years ago and have never looked back. My philosophy is that automation is quite distinct from remote control - 99% of the time the system should look after itself. 
- 🌱 I’m currently seeking to improve my python. To me, good python does its job, and is easy to use and maintain; being 'pythonic' is a secondary consideration. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on providing a complete modular home control system, based on Indigo, that can be easily tailored to operate in anyone's home. The first module, chosen as being easiest to build a 'template' around, is for irrigation in the garden. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... either through Github, or through the Indigodomo user forum, where I am also RedYuriPrime

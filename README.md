- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RedYuriPrime
- ðŸ‘€ Have a long term interest in home automation.
- Developed a whole house system (lights, heating, security, irrigation) under Indigo, which has been running since 2014. My philosophy is that automation is quite distinct from remote control - 99% of the time the system should look after itself.
- Also developed software to integrate the function of green energy devices within the home, e.g. solar panels & battery, energy diverter, car charger, heatpump, etc. This currently saves me about Â£600/year. 
- ðŸŒ± Main programming interest is in python, but also interested in developing apps, e.g. Swift.
